description:
  I'm a incoming CS Ph.D. student at UNC Chapel Hill, advised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). I obtained my master degree from University of Michigan advised by [Prof. Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/). In my master time, I also interned at Boson AI, supervised by [Yi Zhu](https://bryanyzhu.github.io/). Before that, I got my bachelor degree from University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

interest:
  I specialize in <u>Embodied Artificial Intelligence</u> and the <u>Generative AI</u> that interact with humans and their environments. My current research goal is to create AI agents beyond mere perception and reactive generation, to develop rich representations of the world and human partners, enabling deliberative planning and collaboration with humans.

outside-work:
  Beyond work, I enjoy all kinds of sports, building and playing games, watching animations, and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. If we share any interests, feel free to reach out!

call-for-work:
  Iâ€™m always open to research collaborations, project ideas, or just a good conversation. Feel free to contact me via email!
